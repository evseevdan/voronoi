# Installation Information
This program requires specific software to run.
Install Anaconda from the Windows installer at `anaconda.com/download`.
Navigate to the `\anaconda3` documentary and run the following command:
`conda_ create -n ox -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority osmnx jupyterlab`
Once this is complete, launch Anaconda Navigator and make sure you are running on `ox`, not `base`.
Run Jupyter Notebook and open the `voronoi.ipynb` file.
Run the first two cells (module imports and function definitions).
The program is then ready to use.
